# Statement

1. In a study, the researchers wish to see the percentage of registered voters in a  population who were in favor of candidate A in an election was more than 40%. A  random sample of registered voters in this population was taken. Among 800  people participated in the survey, 380 of them voted for candidate A. 

a) Report the 95% confidence interval for estimating the percentage of people in the  population who would vote for candidate A. Please use point estimate Â± margin of  error format to report the confidence interval.  

b) If the researchers would like to estimate a sample size for the study, and there is  no prior knowledge of the proportion, how large a sample would be needed for  constructing a confidence interval for estimating the percentage of people will be  in favor of candidate A with a 95 confidence level and a 2% margin of error? 

2. a) Perform a statistical hypothesis test using 5% as the level of significance to see  if the average arm span for the 11th graders in Ohio is more than 160 cm. You  must state null and alternative hypothesis, check normality assumption, report  test statistic value, report p-value, and draw a proper conclusion. (mean=200)
Null hypothesis: The average arm span for the students is 160cm 
Alternative hypothesis: The average arm span for students is more than 160 cm 
Report p-value from the normality test, make a quantile-comparison plot, and  draw a conclusion. 

b) Find the 95% confidence interval for estimating the average arm span for  the sampled population.
